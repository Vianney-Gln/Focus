      Dom Cobb is an experienced thief - the best there is in the perilous art
      of extraction: his specialty is to appropriate an individual's most
      precious secrets, buried deep in his subconscious, while he dream and that
      his mind is particularly vulnerable. Highly sought after for his talents
      in the murky world of industrial espionage, Cobb has also become a
      globally hunted fugitive who has lost everything he holds dear. But one
      final mission could get him back to his life before - provided he can
      accomplish the impossible: exception. Instead of stealing a dream, Cobb
      and his team must do the opposite: implant an idea into an individual's
      mind. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. And yet, methodical
      and talented as they are, nothing could have prepared Cobb and his
      partners for a formidable foe who seems to be consistently one step ahead
      of them. An enemy that only Cobb could have suspected existed.
