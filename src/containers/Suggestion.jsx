              Dom Cobb is an experienced thief - the best there is in the
              perilous art of extraction: his specialty is to appropriate an
              individuals most precious secrets, buried deep in his
              subconscious, while he dream and that his mind is particularly
              vulnerable. Highly sought after for his talents in the murky world
              of industrial espionage, Cobb has also become a globally hunted
              fugitive who has lost everything he holds dear. But one final
              mission could get him back to his life before - provided he can
              accomplish the impossible: exception. Instead of stealing a dream,
              Cobb and his team must do the opposite: implant an idea into an
              individuals mind. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime.
              And yet, methodical and talented as they are, nothing could have
              prepared Cobb and his partners for a formidable foe who seems to
              be consistently one step ahead of them. An enemy that only Cobb
              could have suspected existed.
